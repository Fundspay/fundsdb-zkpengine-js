GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
<https://fsf.org/>  

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients. You must also make sure that they receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers who use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this license giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to make the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you." "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that requires permission under copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution, making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables others to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

### 1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

### 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously publish an appropriate copyright notice.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may modify your copy of the Program, or any portion of it, and distribute such modifications under this License, provided that:

- The modified work must carry prominent notices stating it has been changed.
- You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License.

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may distribute a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5.

### 7. Additional Terms.
Additional permissions can be added when following the GPL.

### 8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.

### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy of the Program.

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license.

### 11. Patents.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license.

### 12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you that contradict this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
If the Program is a covered work under the AGPL, section 13 allows linking between GPL and AGPL works.

### 14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the GNU General Public License.

### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

### 16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability cannot be given effect, the courts shall apply local laws.

## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program and want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software.

Attach the following notice to each source file:
